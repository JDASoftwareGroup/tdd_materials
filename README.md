Test-driven development materials
=================================

This repository contains useful material for learning test-driven development (TDD).

The subrepositories contain TDD katas, small problems that are solvable within an hour or two.
In addition to lending themselves for practicing TDD, they also are great for revisiting and
implementing alternative solutions just to see how the choice of language, algorithm, test order,
design, etc. impacts the solution.
